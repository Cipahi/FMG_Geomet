Geometallurgical block model -The aim of the work was to develop an algorithm for the selection of the optimal coal blends based in the cross disciplines data
This model developed as linear blending models were not suitable due to the fact that coal and geomet properties are not in a perfect linear relationship.  Coal blending refers to the process of mixing or combining different coals grades that are mined from different seam locations to achieve the desired quality attributes for salable products without penalties
Geostatistics and conditional simulation (provides multiple spatial variation outcomes for scenarios for each seam) were applied to measure and quantify spatial variation of coal qualities (grade) for Ash, Moistures and calorific value for each coal seam as provided in data.  The dummy data have been prepared for classifying product based on the feature considered in this model.
Mine Optimization: Geostats and conditional simulation resulted improved classification of coal grade/waste in each roof and floor of all seams which has improved reserve calculation reflecting actual with short term scheduling pit optimization and minimise the the overall dilution compared to the previous model.
Plant optimization: geometallurgical variables are not necessarily linear or additive and therefore require very careful geostatistical and simulation scenarios to model non-linear. This Identifies the root cause of measured differences in processing behaviour and classify correct classification of products.   

						
 XGBoost has perfromed better than compared to other models in classifying correct product specifications based on the given features.
